PyWebServ: Simple Python Web Server

As simple as putting your html (or whatever else) files into htdocs (or modifying the htdocs path) and firing up
the server.

This is not really intended as production, but more as a novel little thing I decided to do to get more familiar with
sockets and http headers.
